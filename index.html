          <p class="card-text">Here are a few projects that I have completed so far while at Epicodus!</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/selinda-c/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a></li> <p>- This is the first official page I created with the help of Epicodus! I used HTML here. It is fairly bland, but that's okay. It is nice to see how far I've come since just two weeks ago!</em></p>
            <li><a href="">A Blog for each of my dogs</a></li> <p>- This is more practice with HTML and CSS. We had the option to create pages for our pets, and I really enjoyed doing that. </p>
            <li><a href="">An Adoption Website</a></li> <p>- Here we practiced the box model, and cascading. We learned the relationship between <span class="highlight">parent</span> and <span class="highlight">child</span> elements. Additionally we learned that styles can be inherited by <strong>nesting</strong>!</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/selinda-c/vacation">A Webpage about Vacationing to Bali</a></li>
