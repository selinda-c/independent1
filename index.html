          <h1 class="card-title">About Me</h1>
          <p class="card-text">While I have lived in Oregon most of my life, I only just moved to Portland in <strong>February</strong> of 2022!</p>
          <p class="card-text">I am a photographer, a mother to two dogs (<em>Snickers: 10, and Kagome: 3</em>) and two cats (<em>Watson: 3, and Geoff: 2</em>), and I'm an avid nature lover. I'm twenty-six years old, and extremely excited to begin my journey back into the world of coding.</p>
          <p class="card-text">Here's a list of some of my favorite activities, in order:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Photography</strong>:<br> Taking photos of both people and things has been my passion since I was less than 10 years old. I am sure I will never tire of capturing memories.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploring Nature</strong>:<br> I enjoy hiking with my dogs more than I can explain. I am totally enthralled by the beauty that you can find practically in your backyard!</li>
            <li><strong>Coding and web design</strong>:<br> I was thriving back in the time when MySpace was a popular social media site. I would literally spend hours designing and redesigning my profile page. I have always loved learning code and I can't wait to grow the rest of my skills with Epicodus' help!</li>
          </ol>

          <h1 class="card-title">Project List</h1>
          <p class="card-text">Here are a few projects that I have completed so far while at Epicodus!</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/selinda-c/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage</a></li> <p>- This is the first official page I created with the help of Epicodus! I used <span class="highlight">HTML</span> here. It is fairly bland, but that's okay. It is nice to see how far I've come since just two weeks ago!</em></p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/selinda-c/Dog-Blog">A Blog for each of my dogs</a></li> <p>- This is more practice with <span class="highlight">HTML</span> and <span class="highlight">CSS</span>. I had the option to practice my recently learned skills by creating pages for my pets, and I really enjoyed doing that.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/selinda-c/shelter">An Adoption Website</a></li> <p>- Here we practiced the box model, and cascading. We learned the relationship between <span class="highlight">parent</span> and <span class="highlight">child</span> elements. Additionally we learned that styles can be inherited by <strong>nesting</strong>!</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/selinda-c/vacation">A Webpage about Vacationing to Bali</a></li><p>- This was created using Bootstrap! <em>Which I also used to make this portfolio page</em>. In that lesson I learned what Bootstrap is, and how it can help you make a beautiful webpage while cutting down on time spent! I have really enjoyed learning about and implementing <span class="highlight">front-end frameworks</span>. </p>
